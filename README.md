> To get the latest version of the game, go to [releases](https://github.com/vkeshav300/fort-bishop/releases), and find the **newest** release (for example **v1.2.3** is newer than **v1.2.2**).

> Stress test the game. Try to find as many bugs and glitches as you can.

> Make sure to let the developers know when you are done so they can read your report.

## Understanding The Version System
v(x.y.z)
> X is a major release (like from development stages to official first release.)
> Y is a minor release (includes new features, bug fixes, glitch fixes, etc.)
> Z is a bug fix (only will be put in a release if the bug / glitch is partially or fully game breaking.)

**Examples:**
v1.5.4
> Once major relase, five minor relases, and 4 bug fixes
